# sandbox-image

The container image that runs AI agents in isolated sandboxes. Same image
runs in Docker (dev/Pi) and Unikraft (Mac/prod).

## Conventions

- **Language:** Go 1.25+
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits (feat/fix/refactor/docs/test/ci/chore).
  Prefix every commit message. Breaking changes go in the commit footer.
- **Testing:** Standard Go testing with table-driven tests
- **Build:** Use `make` for all operations. Run `make help` for targets.
- **Formatting:** `make fmt` runs goimports + golangci-lint
- **Errors:** Wrap with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- **Constructors:** Use `func NewFoo() *Foo` pattern
- **No manual versions:** semver is automated by semantic-release from commit history

## Package Layout

- `entrypoint/` - Go entrypoint binary (PID 1 in the container)
- `Dockerfile` - Multi-arch container image definition

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Entrypoint binary.** A small Go binary that reads control plane env vars,
   strips them from the environment, drops privileges, and execs the agent.
2. **Env stripping.** SESSION_TOKEN, CONTROL_PLANE_URL, SESSION_ID are read
   into variables then deleted from os.Environ before the agent starts.
3. **Privilege drop.** Container starts as root (needed for setup), drops to
   unprivileged `agent` user before exec-ing the agent command.
4. **Multi-arch.** Dockerfile builds for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 (Pi).
